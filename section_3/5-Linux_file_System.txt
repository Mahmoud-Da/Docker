in Linux everything is files including devices, directories,
Net work socket, pipes, and so on.

EX:
in Windows:
c:\  (drive)
    program files (directory)
    Windows (directory)
    and so

in Linux we have
/ (the root directory)
    (standerd directories)
    bin (includ binaiers or program)
    boot (all the files related to booting)
    dev (devies files)
    etc (we have configurations files)
    home (where home directories for user stored)
    root (home directory for only root user)
    lib (for keeping the library files like software library dependencies)
    var ( where we have files updated frequently)
    proc (including files that repreasent running processes)
