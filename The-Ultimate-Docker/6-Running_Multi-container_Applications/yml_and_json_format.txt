json: is human readable languge to present data
ex: data.json
Yml / Yaml : is also human readable languge to present data (easily to read)

- why we don`t Yml more than Json coz is slower from json (in json we spicife every type of data)
that`s why we use Yml for configuration files (more readble) and json for sending data (faster)
