*** 1- Introduction ***

- Welcome back to another section of the ultimate Docker course. In this section, we're going to
talk about running multi-container applications. 

- So we're going to give we a real world application
with three building blocks, a front end built with React, a back end built with Node, and a
MongoDB database. Once again, we don't need to be familiar or use any of these tools. Our focus
here is on Docker and not on development tools.

- the most exciting part of this
course where we can see everything coming together. We'll talk about Docker compose for
building and running multi-container applications. We'll also talk about Docker networking, database
migration, and running automated tests.
