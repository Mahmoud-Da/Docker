*** 1- Introduction ***

- Welcome back to another section of the ultimate Docker course. In this section, we're going to
talk about running multi-container applications. 

- So we're going to give we a real world application
with three building blocks, a front end built with React, a back end built with Node, and a
MongoDB database. Once again, we don't need to be familiar or use any of these tools. Our focus
here is on Docker and not on development tools.

- the most exciting part of this
course where we can see everything coming together. We'll talk about Docker compose for
building and running multi-container applications. We'll also talk about Docker networking, database
migration, and running automated tests. 
-------------------code----------------------
• Docker Compose
• Docker networking
• Database migration
• Running automated tests

*** 2- Installing Docker Compose ***

- In this section we're going to use a tool called
docker compose which is built on top of docker engine. It makes it incredibly easy
to start applications with multiple containers. 

- So google docker compose install, On this page we can see the installation instructions.
-------------------code----------------------
docs.docker.com/compose/install/
-------------------code----------------------

- Now at the time of recording this, docker compose is shipped with
docker desktop for mac and windows. So if we're on mac or
windows, we don't have to do anything extra. we already have docker compose.
To verify it, just go to the terminal window and type docker compose version.
-------------------code----------------------
$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.33.1-desktop.1
-------------------code----------------------

- So we're running docker compose version 2.33.1. Make sure
the version is the same or newer. 

- Now if we're using an older version, again google upgrade docker compose. Or we might just install
the latest version of docker. 

- Now, back to the installation page.
If we're using windows server or linux, there are specific instructions
we have to follow to install docker compose.
