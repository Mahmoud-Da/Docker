*** 1- Introduction ***
All right, the next stop in our journey is the Linux command line.

- But why Linux? What if we're a Windows user?
Well, we still need to know a bit of Linux for a number of reasons.
For starters, Docker has its foundations built on top of basic Linux concepts.
So if we want to be productive and troubleshoot issues easily,
we need to know some of the basic Linux commands.

- Also, most tutorials online are based on Linux commands.
So if we don't understand these basic commands, we're not going to get far.
learning Linux is like learning English.
so everybody should know some English these days.
You don't need to speak it or write a book in it, but we need to understand it.
So unless we're a power Linux user, do not skip this section.
It's going to be super easy and extremely useful.
So let's jump in and get started.

*** 2- Linux Distributions ***

- Let's start off this section by talking about Linux distributions, 
also called Linux distros.

- So, as we probably know, Linux is open source software.
And for this reason, many individuals and communities
have created their own version of Linux called Linux distributions.

- Each of these distributions is made to fit specialized needs
like running servers, desktop computers, mobile phones and so on.

- So we have Ubuntu, which is one of the most popular Linux distributions.
We also have Debian, Alpine, which we briefly talked about, it's a very small Linux distribution.

- We also have Fedora, CentOS and so on.

- Believe it or not, there are more than a thousand Linux distributions out there.

- Now, most of these distributions support pretty much the same set of commands,
but sometimes we might discover differences along the way. So be aware of that.

- In this section, we're going to use Ubuntu Linux because it's one of the most popular distributions.
But if we have a preference for another distribution, that's totally fine.
