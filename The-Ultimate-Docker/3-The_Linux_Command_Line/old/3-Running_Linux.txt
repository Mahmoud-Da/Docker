we will use Ubuntu (coz most famous)


to install:
- we go to hup.docker.com and search for the Ubuntu
- we will download the official image for Ubuntu(more than 10M+)
- we click on the image and the download command will appear
download command
docker pull ubuntu

but instade of running Docker pull,
we can use docker run ubuntu directly
=>
NOW,
if we have this image locally:
Docker is going to start a container with this image.

otherwise:
it`s going to pull the image behind the scene and then start
a container

when we typed 'docker run ubuntu' Docker started a container
but cuz we didn`t interact with the container the container stopped
(run 'docker ps -a' to check )

to solve that we have to start the container in
interactive mode

after typing:
docker  -it run ubentu
we will have
root@2f759e6996e9:/#

we will have a shell: (root@2f759e6996e9:/#)
shell is a program that takes our commands and passes
them to the OP (karnel) for excution

root is repreasents the currently logged in user
(root has the highest prvileges)
after the @ sign
we have (2f759e6996e9) the name of the mashine

So, this container has this ID, which is automatically
created by docker.

(/) this repreasents whree we are in the file system
in this case forward slash is repreasents the root directly
(the highest directly file in the system)

(#) means we have the highest prvileges, cuz we logged as root user
if logged as normal user we will find ($1) instead

if we type 'echo $0'
result '/bin/bash'
inside the shell we will have the location of the shell program
bin is directly and bash is program which is a shirtcut
for "Bourne again shell"
Steve Bourne is the first person who created a shell program

in linux:
-we use forward slash to sperad the directly but in windows we use
back slashes
-the other difference is Linux is case sensitive OP,
So if we type 'Echo' we capital e it`s not going to work
so lower case and upper case are different not only in commands but it`s
aplicable everywhere
=> if we want to refrence a user or directly or command we should
spell it properly with the right uppercases and lowecases

if we want to play with history
- we can use arrows up and down to see the previos command
- use history command
ex:
'history'
result
1 *
2 whoami
3 echo $0

if we run '!2'
same as running 'whoami'
