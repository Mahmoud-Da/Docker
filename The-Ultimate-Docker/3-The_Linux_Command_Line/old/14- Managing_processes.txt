  PID TTY           TIME CMD

(the program that take our command and send it the OS for excution)
PID: is the id that generated by the OS
TTY: (short for teletype)
000 the first terminal window
TIME: how much the program is heavy(taking the cpu time)

- sleep (make the terminal sleeo for 3 scconds and then wakeup)

  PID TTY           TIME CMD
 1317 ttys000    0:00.14 -zsh
 2095 ttys000    0:00.00 sleep 100

if the program take too mush of the CPU time and want to kill
we type
- kill + PID of the program
ex:
kill 2095
[1]  + 2095 terminated  sleep 100
