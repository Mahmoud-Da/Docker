*** 1- Introduction ***
- In this section we're going to explore containers in more detail. 

-We'll talk about starting and stopping containers,
publishing ports, viewing container logs, executing commands in running containers,
removing containers, persisting data using volumes, and sharing source code with containers
so we don't have to rebuild our image every time we make a change in our code.
