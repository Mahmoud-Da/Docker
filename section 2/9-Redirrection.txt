Redirection: (>)to redirect output | (<) to redirect input
one of the most important concepts in linux
is the concept of the input and output.

=> so the standerd input repreasents the keyboard,
and standerd output repreasents the screen

but we can always change the source of the input and output
this is called => Redirection

ex:
when we use
'cat file1.txt'
cat program read the data from file1.txt and prints
it on the standerd output (screen)

so we can use the redirection operator
ex:
cat file1.txt > file2.txt
here we redirect the output from the screen to the another file

to use cat command to combaine multiple files
ex:
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combaine.txt
here we combaine two files to one file
