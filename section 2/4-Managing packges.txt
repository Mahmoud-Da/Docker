package manager:
most of development platform or  OS comes with package manager

ex:
npm
yarn
pip
NuGet
apt (fro Ubuntu)

Ex:
if we want a package like nano(text editer)

'apt install nano'
=> unable to locate package nano

cuz nano package is not installed in apt package manager(Ubuntu)
we can type
'apt list' to check all the list of packages in apt

to solve that we use
'apt update' to update our package manager database
=> now if we typed
'apt list' we will see more packages
and we can install a package like nano

SO, before we install a package we always must update our
package manager database
