and all the commands of the linux are programs or binaiers
in the bin directory


-pwd (print working directory)


-ls (shorting for list)
options
ls -1 for viewing the files horizontally
ls -l to see all the files in details
we can check a file even if we are not in the current path
ls bin


-cd (to enter a directory)
we can use a relative or absolute path
cd .. (to go up one level)
cd ../.. (to go two levels up)
cd ~ (to go to our home directory)

To Edit a file:
-mkdir (to create a directory)


-mv (to rename a directory)
ex: mv test docker (rename test to docker)


-touch (to create a new file)
ex: touch hello.txt
ez2: touch hello.txt hello.py (multiple files as same time)


-rm to remove a file or multiple files
ex; rm hello.txt hi.txt
ex:rm file* (remove all the files which start with files)


- rm -r (to remove a directory and all it`s recursively)


- nano filename (to edit a file after installing nano library)


to view a file:
-cat file.txt (too se the content of a file)
cat is usful when the file is short and fits on one age
but if are dealing with a long file it`s better to use more
commands

- more (to see the content of a file)(long file)
problem (we can scroll only down)

-less (to see the content of a file)(long file)
we can scroll up and down

-head (to reviw a few lines of the file)(first)
ex: head -n 5 file.txt
the first 5 lines of file.txt

-tail (to reviw a few lines of the file)(last)
ex: tail -n 5 file.txt
the last 5 lines of file.txt


searching commands:
-grep (global regular expression print)
-if want to search in file
ex: grep hello file1.txt
-if the "Hello" was in upper case
we use
grep -i hello file1.txt (-i to cancel the insensitive)
resule "Hello"
-if want to search in multi files
grep -i hello file1.txt file2.txt
or
grep -i hello file* (all the files which name started with file)
-if want to search in directories
we use -r
grep -i -r hello . (period to refer to a directory and sub_directories)


*in Linux we can combine multiple options
ex : grep -i -r hello .
=>  grep -ir hello .
