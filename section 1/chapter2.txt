Virtual Machines(VM) VS Containers:
container :
an isolated enviroment for running an application.
Virtual Machines:
an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware)
=> so we can run several virtual machines on real physical mashine

Ex:
we have mac
we can run on it two virtual machines (on is Windows and the other is  Linux)

to run a virtual machine:
we use  a tool called Hypervisor

Hypervisor is software we use to create a mange virtual machines

some Hypervisor softwares:
VirtualBox (cross platform)
VMware (cross platform)
Hyper-v (Windows only)

the benefit of VM:
we can run an applications in isolation inside a virtual machine
=> in the same physical machine we can have two virtual machines
everyone is run a complatly different application and each application
has the exac dependencies it means

Ex:
VM1(Windows):
mongo 3
node 14

VM2(Linux):
mongo 3
node 9

all is running on the same physical machine but in different isolated enviroment.


Problem with VM:
- each VM needs a full-blow OS
- slow to start (cuz all the OS has to be loaded just like starting computer)
- Resource intensive (cuz each VM takes a slice of actual
physical hard of resources like CPU and memory and else) => we can`t run too mach VM


container:
- allows running multiple apps in isolation
- more lightwight than VM
- use only the OS of the host
- start quickly (cuz aleady installed on the host)
- need less hardware resources (we can run 100 of conta side by side)
